================

Objective:
To become familiar with covert channels and to design a covert channel using the TCP/IP protocol suite.

Requirements
- Study Craig Rowland’s program and 3 techniques for covertly embedding data into headers
- Analyze and critique the code, identifying 1 or more weaknesses and demonstrate how you work rectify them
- Modify the code base to send data covertly in a method that has not already been demonstrated

Constraints
- Implemented technique for embedding covert data into the headers must be one that is not covered in Rowland’s paper
- Only the TCP, UDP, or IP headers are to be used for this exercise
- All supporting data for success (or lack thereof) of the embedding scheme must be shown
